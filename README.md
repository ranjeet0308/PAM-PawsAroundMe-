 PAM-PawsAroundMe-

A community map for caring about stray animals.

2. Add description (e.g., “Friendly brown dog, hangs around tea shop, looks hungry”).
3. Upload photos of the animal.

Community Feed:
1. Other users can view the marker, description, and pics.
2. Option to comment, update status, or confirm if the animal is still there.

Filter/Search:
1. Filter by cats/dogs, “Needs food”, “Needs shelter”, “Injured”, etc.
2. Search by area to find stray animals nearby.

Gamification:
1. Earn badges for helping (e.g., “Feeder”, “Rescuer”).
